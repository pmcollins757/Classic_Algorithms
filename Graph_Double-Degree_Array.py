Problem
Source: Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani. McGraw-Hill. 2006.

Given: A simple graph with n â‰¤ 10**3 vertices in the edge list format
(The first line contains two numbers, 
the number of vertices n and the number of edges m, 
each of the following m lines contains an edge given by two vertices.).

Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the sum of 
the degrees of i's neighbors.

Sample Dataset:

5 4
1 2
2 3
4 3
2 4

Sample Output:

3 5 5 5 0
