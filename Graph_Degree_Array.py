Graph Degree Array

Problem
In an undirected graph, 
the degree d(u) of a vertex u is the number of neighbors u has, 
or equivalently, the number of edges incident upon it.

Given: A simple graph with n â‰¤ 10**3 vertices in the edge list format.

Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the degree of vertex i.

Sample Dataset:
(The first line contains two numbers, 
the number of vertices n and the number of edges m, 
each of the following m lines contains an edge given by two vertices.)

6 7
1 2
2 3
6 3
5 6
2 5
2 4
4 1

Sample Output:

[2 4 2 2 2 2]
